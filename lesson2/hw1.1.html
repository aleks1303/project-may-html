    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a> . A free-spirited and mischievous young boy

<h2>Origin
    <span>[ <a href="#">edit</a> ]</span></h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">Little White Bird</a> (1902), a novel for adults. In
    chapters
    13–18, titled "Peter Pan in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a>",
    Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
    Kensington Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as
    "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of
    his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)">stage play</a> titled <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who
        Wouldn't Grow Up</a>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of
        York's Theatre</a> in London.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
    Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_%26_Stoughton">Hodder and Stoughton,</a>
    extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in
        Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition of illustrations by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Barrie later adapted and expanded
    the
    1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a>.
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating
    accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup><a
